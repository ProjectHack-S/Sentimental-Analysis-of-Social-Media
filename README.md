# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Social-Media
Sentiment in the social media (Twitter) plays a big role in managing the perception of an organization. This sentiment can have an impact in the stock price of listed companies.

This will give the corporate communications department a very important tool to monitor the leading indicator (social media sentiment) in order to estimate the lagging indicator (stock price).
